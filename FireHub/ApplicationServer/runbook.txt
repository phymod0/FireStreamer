Torrenting steps:
- Make sure auth is disabled in the transmissions config (sudo /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json)
- Get a session ID by failing a request (the request you want to perform or the specific request for getting the session ID if inapplicable)
- Include the Session ID with the 'X-Transmission-Session-Id' HTTP header in the POST request you make to transmissions
- Follow RFC specification link for server API documentation
